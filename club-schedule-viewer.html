Beginners learn effective attack and defense techniques from the start, such as punches, various kicks, foot sweeps, and deflections. This way, they can gain their first practical experience at tournaments with the yellow belt. The foundation is a balanced physical and motor training, complemented by stretching, exercises to improve general fitness, movement coordination, and reaction. Modern sport karate is not a full-contact sport. Both in training and competition, great emphasis is placed on precise stopping and clean execution of techniques. The risk of injury is much lower than in many trend sports. Since competitive fighting is the best school for effective self-defense, you also have the necessary power for emergencies. Through regular training and competition practice, you gain confidence and self-assurance, especially in tricky situations."
